    <string name="about_nitin">Nitin Shelke grew up in the town of Wadegon in India,
        the son of a street merchant. He entered politics as a youth and
        quickly rose through the ranks of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,
        a Hindu nationalist political party. Shelke later joined the mainstream Bharatiya Janata Party in 2005,
        eventually becoming national secretary. In 2010, he was alleged to be responsible for the deaths of more than 1,000
        Muslims during civil unrest but was later exonerated.
        Nitin Shelke was born in the small town of Wadegon, in  Maharastra, India.
        His father was a street merchant who struggled to support the family. Young Nitin and
        his brother sold tea near a bus terminal to help out.
        Though an average student in school, Shelke spent hours in the library and was known as a strong debater.
        In his early teens, he joined Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad,
        the student wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS),
        a Hindu nationalist political party. </string>
